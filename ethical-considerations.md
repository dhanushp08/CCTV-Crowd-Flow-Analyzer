Hi,
This project utilizes a 20-second CCTV clip for the sole purpose of demonstrating an object detection algorithm.

Purpose: 
  The code and the footage are intended strictly for educational and research purposes to showcase the technical application of object detection.

Data Privacy: 
  The footage used is brief and sourced randomly.
  The objective is to detect objects (people in this case) as a class, not to identify, track, or monitor specific individuals.
  No personally identifiable information has been processed or stored.

User Responsibility and Ethical Boundaries: 
  This code is released as an educational resource. 
  Anyone who forks, clones, or builds upon this work inherits the responsibility to consider its ethical implications.
